                <li>apoptosis as a natural, regulatory process of programmed cell death, initiated after a cell receives a signal from inside (mitochondrial pathway) or from outside (death receptor pathway) the cell resulting in the removal of cells that are no longer needed or that may be a threat to an organism, mediated by enzymes (caspases) that cleave specific proteins in the cytoplasm or nucleus</li>

    <h3>Teacher background information</h3>
    <div class="clearfix">
        <div class="left">
            <h4>Module description</h4>
            <p>Cancer is a topic that is featured significantly in scientific research and the media.  The detection of cancer in people has increased; and it is very likely that students may have had a family member touched by cancer.  Wherever they have heard or experienced the term, there is still the likelihood they have a limited understanding on the basic cell biology of cancer itself.</p>
            <p>In this module, we introduce the concept that normal cells have a capacity to undergo genetic mutations which alter a cell’s natural biological processes.  Cancer is the term used to describe a large group of diseases characterized by the progressive and uncontrolled growth of abnormal cells.</p> 
            <p>Students are then introduced to some of the factors that change normal cell behaviors to represent the ‘progressive and uncontrolled growth’ in cancer.  These include genetic mutations, which lead to an increase in cell replication and malfunctions in apoptosis, the process of programmed cell death that helps maintain a consistent amount of healthy cells in our body.</p>

    <p><span class="time"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/time.svg" alt="" class="clock"> 1 hour</span></p>
    <p><b>Student knowledge/ skills outcome:</b></p>
    <ul>
        <li>identify cancer as the progressive and uncontrolled growth of abnormal cells</li>
        <li>identify a mutation as a genetic modification to a cell’s DNA</li>
        <li>describe cancerous characteristics such as increased cell replication and a decrease in cell death</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>Prior Knowledge:</b> None required</p>
    <h5>Activities</h5>
    <div class="activity">
        <p>Activity 1.1 - <strong>What do you know about cancer?</strong>  (10 - 20 mins)</p>
        <p>Use a number of quick and effective brainstorming-based activities to identify what 	students currently know about cancer. These brainstorming activities enable everyone’s ideas to be expressed and stimulates thought and creativity. The following activities are designed to elicit students’ pre-instructional understanding of cancer.</p>
        <p><strong>Options:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>KWL chart: Ask students to complete a KWL chart (What I already Know about cancer; What would I like to know; What I have learned). Column three is completed at the end of this module. This activity is designed to assist students in visualizing what they know about cancer.</li>  
            <li>Whole class mind map (teacher-guided discussion)</li>
            <li>Small group discussions (followed by sharing their information to the rest of the class)</li>
            <li>Collating individual contributions (for classes where students may have a fear of saying the ‘wrong thing’, or where a teacher would like everyone to participate); a teacher can ask each student to write down his or her thoughts about cancer.  The teacher then collects them and quickly organizes them into categories (or places them all up on the board and gets students to categorise them). The students go over the categories and discusses the similarities, differences, consistencies and inconsistencies.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="activity"> 
        <p>Activity 1.2 - <strong>A webquest: What is Cancer?</strong> (1 – 2hrs)</p>
        <p>This research-based activity is aimed at developing student understanding of the changes in cellular processes that result in cancer. Students are given a list of research 	questions to answer.  Students evaluate the following range of visual and aural resources to source their information. Students are also encouraged to source 	additional information.</p>
        <p>Educators can then select the option of how students demonstrate their understanding via a range of individual or group activities (An inquiry worksheet to be created, which includes an assessment rubric).  It includes the following research questions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>What is cancer? Summarise what you now know about cancer</li> 
            <li>Describe/illustrate how cells become cancerous</li>
            <li>List the similarities and differences between normal and cancerous cells (provide a VENN diagram to complete)</li>
            <li>Explain the process of mestatistis</li>
            <li>With some cancer treatments, a tumor can shrink but not disappear. Explain why?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Students are provided with the following online resources as part of a mini webquest:</p>

        <p>Activity 1.3 - <strong>Role Play: How do cancer cells evade death?</strong>  </p>
        <p>Students investigate the process of apoptosis and the ways in which cancer cells mutate to prevent programmed cell death.</p>  
        <p>Within a role play environment, students create a number of questions and answers explain the role and function of apoptosis and how mutations stop apoptosis, contributing to the rapidly expanding number of cancers cells that develop into tumors. All students research and prepare questions and answers.</p>
        <p>Some questions could be:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>What is a genetic mutation?</li>
            <li>Can you explain how cancer cells grow into tumors</li>
            <li>Why do cancer cells grow quickly?</li>
            <li>What is apoptosis and explain why cancer cells avoid this process?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>(I’d prefer to encourage students to create their own question/answers)</p>
        <p>The role plays, focusing on students being ‘scientific researchers’  can be implemented 	using a number of different strategies:</p>
        <ol type="a">
            <li><a href="http://www.mantleoftheexpert.com/about-moe/introduction/" target="_blank">Mantle of the expert</a> – Where students become the experts and the teacher guides them through a role play. The scenario could be a science forum where they (a panel of scientists) are posed the discussion question of ‘What is apoptosis, and how does cancer evade apoptosis?’</li> 
            <li>Hot Seating (whole class)- A widely used and very effective Drama strategy. Questions are asked to someone sitting in the 'hot-seat' who answers in character (an immunologist). Set this up by telling the class they will have an opportunity to pose questions to the immunologist based on their prior research.</li>
            <li>Hot seating (in pairs) – Using the same methodology above, students can either present their role plays live in class, or video tape them for viewing by the class or just the teacher. An activity handout and rubric will need to be developed. This activity lends itself for peer or self-assessment.</li>
