        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Included here is a collection of useful links to support the teacher to move seamlessly throughout the topic. This sequence is includes three modules. The modules align with the different parts VCE Biology Study Design 2017-2021 and explore the key knowledge dot points of Responding to Antigens. The intent of this learning sequence is to pool useful resources to provide the user with a ‘one stop shop’ for locating information relevant to AoS2, Outcome 2 Responding to Antigens. I would like to acknowledge medical scientist Helen Haysom for her support and expert advice.</p>
        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Module 1 uses the context of the ABO blood grouping to introduce important concepts in immunology.</li>
            <li>Module 2 extends these ideas and explores the levels of immune response to antigens.</li>
            <li>Module 3  provides a series of resources to the structure of the lymphatics system.</li>
        </ul>
